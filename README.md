# DA2_and_Coding1_Assign2_Renewable_energy

This is the GitHub repo for the joint assignment for DA2 and Coding1 on the assoiation between the consumption of renewable energy and countryâ€™s economic growth in
year 2013.

The repo contains:

- **Data folder**: The clean data set is a cross-sectional data set that includes growth rate of GDP per capita (gdppc_growth_percentage),percentage of renewable 
energy consumption (percentage_renewable_eng_consmp), growth rate of gross capital formation (gross_capital_formation_percentage), growth rate of population (pop_growth_percentage), 
percentage of forest area (forest_area_percentage),and a dummy variable developed from 159 countries in year 2013.

Short explanations of variable used:

1. percentage_renewable_rng_consmp: renewable energy consumption (% of total final energy consumption)
2. gdppc_growth_percentage: GDP per capita growth (annual %)
3. gross_capital_formation_percentage: gross capital formation (annual % growth)
4. pop_growth_percentage: population growth (annual %)
5. forest_area_percentage: forest area (% of land area)
6. Developed: dummy variable, equals to 1 if country is developed, 0 otherwise.

This data set is taken from the World Bank- World Development Indicators, with the following indicator code: 
1. EG.FEC.RNEW.ZS: Renewable energy consumption
2. NY.GDP.PCAP.KD.ZG: GDP per capita growth
3. NE.GDI.TOTL.KD.ZG: Gross capital formation
4. SP.POP.GROW: Population growth
5. AG.LND.FRST.ZS: Forest area

- **Codes folder**:The codes folder includes the following:

1. renew_energy_getdata.R: this is the R script that collects all the data used in this analysis.
2. renew_energy_clean.R: this is the R script that contains the steps of cleaning the data set before doing analysis.
3. renew_energy_analysis.R: this is the R script with all the analysis part of this project. 
4. renew_energy_analysis.Rmd: same as renew_energy_analysis.R but in .Rmd. You should be able to replicate my results by running this Rmd file.
5. Assignment_2.Rproj: Project file is also included so you should be able to open all the R scripts and Rmd file in this project. 
 
 
 
- **Docs folder**: it contains both .html and .pdf generated from .rmd.



- **Output folder**: in this folder, you can find the code generated model summary statistics table in the html format, and also a screenshot of the html result.
